In our daily life, we have to keep track of our expenses and keep a note of the amount we owe to our friends/relatives or the amount they owe us. For example, When we go on a trip or for dinner in a group, then usually it is convenient that only one person pays for the bill. Manually keeping track of these expenses will be inefficient, time-consuming, and error-prone. Errors made in manually maintaining the expenses could end up consuming a large amount of time, figuring out the error. So, we need a tool that will keep track of our expenses, which is the main motivation behind developing the system. 

This project is meant to offer a shared expenses solution that is faster, easier, and more convenient than manually calculating and handling expenses. 

The following are some of the main features and the functionalities to add to the system as per the user requirement. The features are divided into two parts: Core features and optional features of which core features are important for the application's activity while the optional features will add some new functionality to the system. The last option features might be executed as time permits.
